IVUL-Resources
***************

Born on Feb 11, 2021.

IVUL-Resources website:  for collecting resources for our IVUL-family, \etc group tutorials, group paper reading, suggested/presented papers in each theme,  datasets collected for easy deployment, documentation on how to set up and use group/KAUST resources (like node center, skynet, ibex).
Hopefully,  IVUL-Resources can be beneficial to all of us, and helps the new members in our family grows faster.
Later, IVUL-Resources later should even supports basic framework for image/video/3d/fundamental deep learning (just like OpenMMLAB, but more specially for us. )

- Well organized:

 For example, each tutorial item is organized in one row of a table, containing: Date (yyyy/mm/dd), Title, Key Words, Speaker, Link information for such tutorial.

- Ease our work

 For example, KITTI Lidar detection is put in one google link (so that you do not have to download each part of the dataset one by one, which is super annoying).

- Supports search

 IVUL-Resources supports search. that means: you can search for a specific tutorial (or anything you want) by a sparse word of the title (if you cannot remeber the full name of the title), the speaker, the date, or some keywords.
